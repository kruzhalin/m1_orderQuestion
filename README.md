**Task Description:**

> Find here attached the user case we want to develop:

> We want you to build a customer's page inÂ which customers can ask questions about their order.

> Customers should fill in the order number and email, in which after validation the customer will see their order products data displayed.

> In that page, the customer will be able to write a question and be able to send it, which should be saved in a grid and displayed in a section in Magneto (saved in a separated table and displayed in admin area).

> Lastly by a cronjob, we are sending new questions to a manager (this email should be configured per store in the admin area). The manager should receive a notification that a new question has been created.
